# image-segmentation
Performs image segmentation using region growing algorithms.

Image segmentation is a process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments. Usually, the segmentation simplifies the image
and makes it easier to analyze. The segments supposed to represent meaningful regions of the original image.

Region growing approach is a simple approach to image segmentation. It starts with the user selected seed points and grows each of
them into a region based on a region membership criterion. In this project a seed is a single pixel and the membership criterion is based
on the gray level values of the pixels.

This was my third project in my Data Structures course, implementing stacks and queues.
